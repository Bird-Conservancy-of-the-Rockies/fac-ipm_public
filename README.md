# fac-ipm_public
Publicly accessible version of full-annual-cycle, integrated population model (FAC-IPM) code.

Contents herein support the manuscript *Linked dynamic abundance models as the basis for a full-annual-cycle, integrated population model*.

The repository has two primary sections, each contained in a subdirectory of the root directory:

1. `sim` contains code and results from the simulation study
2. `fit` contains code for the case study, where the FAC-IPM is fit to a dataset 
for Baird's Sparrow (*Centronyx bairdii*)

Each of these subdirectories has its own `README.md` file.  See those files for details about exploring and using the code.
